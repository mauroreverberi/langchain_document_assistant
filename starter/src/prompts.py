Given the user input and conversation history, classify the user's intent into one of these categories:

- summarization: Requests to summarize or extract key points from documents that do not require calculations.
- calculation: Mathematical operations or numerical computations. Or questions about documents that may require calculations
- unknown: Cannot determine the intent clearly

Examples:
- "Who are the parties in the service agreement?" -> qa
- "What does the contract say about termination?" -> qa
- "Summarize all contracts" -> summarization
- "Give me the key points of document INV-001" -> summarization
- "What is the total amount in invoice INV-001?" -> calculation
- "Add up the totals of all invoices" -> calculation

User Input: {user_input}

Recent Conversation History:

Analyze the user's request and classify their intent with a confidence score and brief reasoning.
